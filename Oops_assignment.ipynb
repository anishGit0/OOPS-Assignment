        "  Method Overriding and Extension: When you override a method in a child class, you might still want to call the original method from the parent class. `super()` allows you to do this without explicitly naming the parent class. This is useful for extending the functionality of the parent class method while adding specific behavior in the child class.\n",

        "  Multiple Inheritance: In cases of multiple inheritance, `super()` helps in navigating the method resolution order (MRO) and ensuring that methods from all parent classes are called in the correct sequence.\n",

        "  Maintaining Code Flexibility: Using `super()` makes your code more flexible and maintainable. If you change the name of the parent class in the future, you don't need to update all the child class methods that call the parent class methods."
